## Motivation {.smaller}

The purple line, a new light rail system north of DC, is scheduled to open in late 2027.

![](images/purpleline.png){fig-align="center" width="50%"}

Has past light rail openings lead to a decrease in air pollution?

## What are Light Rails? {.smaller}

-   Light Rails are electric-powered vehicles on dedicated tracks.

-   They usually run alongside roads, with dedicated rights-of-way.

## Light Rails vs. Subways {.smaller}

-   Light rails have a lower passenger capacity.

-   Light rails make more frequent stops.

-   Light rails are much cheaper to build.

## Literature Review {.smaller}

-   Existing studies have found that **subways** systems are effective in reducing air pollution.

    -   Chen & Whalley (2012) found that Taipei's Metro System opening reduced CO by 5 to 15 percent.

    -   Gendron-Carrier et al. (2022) found that among 58 subways openings globally, only those in highly polluted cities see a 4 percent reduction.

    -   Xie et al. (2024) found that 15 subways openings in China reduced PM2.5 by 19 percent.

-   Fageda (2021) is the only study that used a quasi-experimental research design to estimate the impact of **light rail** openings across 98 European cities, and found a small reduction of 3 percent.

## Hypothesis {.smaller}

-   Light rail openings in the US will make shift people from driving their own cars or taking buses to using the light rail, reducing air pollution.

-   We expect to see smaller decrease than 3 percent as:

    -   The US population drives more cars than Europe.

    -   We will data from light rail construction period, which can increase pollution prior light rail opening, from our analysis.

## Data {.smaller}

-   Daily PM2.5, from the years 2000 to 2016 with 1 km x 1 km grid resolution from Di et al. (2019).

-   47 land surface meteorological variables with 25 km x km grid resolution from NASA GLDAS 2.

-   Treated city selection criteria

    -   Light rail construction period must start a few years after 2000.

    -   Buses were the primary public transit mode before the light rail opened.

-   These criteria narrows down to two light rail systems:

    -   **Charlotte, NC's LYNX system**, which opened in 2007

    -   **Phoenix, AZ's Valley Metro Rail system**, which opened in 2008

## Research Design {.smaller}

-   Previous studies on subway's impact on air pollution (Chen and Whalley, 2012; Gendron-Carrier et al., 2022; Xie et al., 2024) used Discontinuity-Based OLS as there was instant uptake in ridership.

-   We will use **difference-in-difference** as light rail ridership gradually increased treated cities.

## Treated Area

-   We indicate potential highways that are the light rails serve as a substitute, and draw 1.5 km buffers around each highway.

-   We then find the average daily PM2.5 and meteorological variables within those areas.

## Untreated Area

For each control city, we find cities with no light rails, no subways, and similar public transportation profiles.

## Untreated Area

-   For each untreated city, we draw a 30 km radius around each city's centroid, crop interstates segments that fall within that centroid, and draw 1 km radius around each cropped interstate.

-   We then find the daily average PM2.5 levels within each 1 km radius around the cropped interstate area for each city.

## DiD Methodology

For each treatment city, we use data from untreated city with similar public pre-light-rail transportation profiles as controls. Our main regression specification is:

$P_{it}=\gamma (D_i \times Open_t) + W'_{it} \beta +\mu_{it} + \epsilon{it}$

where $P_{it}$ are PM2.5 levels (in ug/m3) for each city $i$ and day $t$.

$D_i$ is a dummy variable that is equal to one when city $i$ is the city with a light rail system.

$Open_t$ is a dummy variable that is equal to one when the light rail system in the treated city is in operation.

$W_{it}$ includes 47 meteorological control variables in its linear, square, and cubic form for each city and day.

$\mu_it$ are city-day of week-month-year fixed effects.
