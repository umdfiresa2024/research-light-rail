## Motivation {.smaller}

The purple line, a new light rail system north of DC, is scheduled to open in late 2027.

![](images/purpleline.png){fig-align="center" width="50%"}

Has past light rail openings lead to a decrease in air pollution?

## Hypothesis {.smaller}

With a light rail opening, people will shift from driving cars to using the light rail instead, reducing air pollution.

## Light Rail Routes {.smaller}

-   Our PM2.5 data starts from the year 2000, so we focus on US light rail systems that are built after that time.

-   We chose cities where buses and cars were the primary mode of transit prior light rail opening.

-   After considering these criteria, our panel of cities was narrowed down to two systems:

-   Charlotte, NC's LYNX system which opened in 2007

-   Phoenix, AZ's Valley Metro Rail system which opened in 2009.

## Literature Review {.smaller}

-   Previous studies on the air pollution impact of public transit (Chen and Whalley, 2012; Gendron-Carrier et al., 2022; Xie et al., 2024) used Discontinuity-Based OLS as there was instant uptake in ridership.

## Literature Review {.smaller}

-   *Fageda (2021)* used DiD to estimate the impact of light rail openings across 98 European cities, and found that air pollution was reduced by 3 percent.

-   They study used annual PM2.5 data, going back only up to 3 years before opening, which can confound with construction time.

## Treated Area

## Untreated Area

For each control city, we find cities with no light rails, no subways, and similar public transportation profiles.

## Untreated Area

-   For each untreated city, we draw a 30 km radius around each city's centroid, crop interstates segments that fall within that centroid, and draw 1 km radius around each cropped interstate.

-   We then find the daily average PM2.5 levels within each 1 km radius around the cropped interstate area for each city.

## DiD Methodology

For each treatment city, we use data from untreated city with similar public pre-light-rail transportation profiles as controls. Our main regression specification is:

$P_{it}=\gamma (D_i \times Open_t) + W'_{it} \beta +\mu_{it} + \epsilon{it}$

where $P_{it}$ are PM2.5 levels (in ug/m3) for each city $i$ and day $t$.

$D_i$ is a dummy variable that is equal to one when city $i$ is the city with a light rail system.

$Open_t$ is a dummy variable that is equal to one when the light rail system in the treated city is in operation.

$W_{it}$ includes 48 meteorological control variables in its linear, square, and cubic form for each city and day.

$\mu_it$ are city-day of week-month-year fixed effects.

## Synthetic Control Methodology

-   We use the synthetic control method described in Abadie et al. (2008)

-   To construct a synthetic city for each treated city, we minimize the gap in PM2.5 trends before construction time.

-   We also include 47 meteorology variables, CO2, NO2, and SO2 emissions from power plants in the same county, and number of public bus and car trips.
