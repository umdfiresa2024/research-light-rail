## Why Light Rail? {.smaller}

-   Light rail is a form of rail public transit with trains that combine features from buses and subways.

-   Compared to buses:

    -   Higher capacity, more frequent operation

    -   Lower maintenance

    -   Can have exclusive right-of-way

-   Compared to subways:

    -   Cheaper to construct a new system (no tunnels needed!)

    -   Can reach more residents and stop at more locations

## Data: Light Rail Routes {.smaller}

-   We focus on light rail systems in our study opened after the 2000s (our PM2.5 dataset has data from 2000 to 2016).

-   We picked systems in cities where light rail was the primary mode of rail transit, allowing us to isolate air pollution effects resulting from the opening of a light rail.

-   Cities with a population of at least 1 million residents were picked to ensure light rails were in urban cities.

-   After considering these criteria, our panel of cities was narrowed down to two systems:

    **Charlotte, NC's LYNX system and Phoenix, AZ's Valley Metro Rail system.**

## Data: PM2.5 and Meteorology {.smaller}

-   PM2.5 data comes from Di et al. (2019), which provides daily PM2.5 concentrations in grid cells at a resolution of 1 km for the years 2000 to 2016.

-   To consider meteorological conditions, we include 48 land surface meteorological variables provided by NASA Global Land Data Assimilation System Version 2. The data set provides rasters with a raster of 0.25 x0.25 degree daily.

-   For each treated city, we identified which highway light rails could potentially serve as a substitute, and we extracted daily levels of PM2.5 and our meteorological variables from areas within 1 km of those highways.

## Literature Review {.smaller}

-   Previous studies on the air pollution impact of public transit (Chen and Whalley, 2012; Gendron-Carrier et al., 2022; Xie et al., 2024) used Discontinuity-Based OLS as there was instant uptake in ridership.

## Literature Review {.smaller}

-   *Fageda, 2021* used DiD to estimate the impact of light rail openings across 98 European cities, and found that air pollution was reduced by 3 percent.

-   Their study used annual PM2.5 data, going back only up to 3 years before opening, which can confound with construction time.

## Untreated Area

For each control city, we find cities with no light rails, no subways, and similar public transportation profiles.

## Untreated Area

-   For each untreated city, we draw a 30 km radius around each city's centroid, crop interstates segments that fall within that centroid, and draw 1 km radius around each cropped interstate.

-   We then find the daily average PM2.5 levels within each 1 km radius around the cropped interstate area for each city.

## DiD Methodology

For each treatment city, we use data from untreated city with similar public pre-light-rail transportation profiles as controls. Our main regression specification is:

$P_{it}=\gamma (D_i \times Open_t) + W'_{it} \beta +\mu_{it} + \epsilon{it}$

where $P_{it}$ are PM2.5 levels (in ug/m3) for each city $i$ and day $t$.

$D_i$ is a dummy variable that is equal to one when city $i$ is the city with a light rail system.

$Open_t$ is a dummy variable that is equal to one when the light rail system in the treated city is in operation.

$W_{it}$ includes 48 meteorological control variables in its linear, square, and cubic form for each city and day.

$\mu_it$ are city-day of week-month-year fixed effects.

## Synthetic Control Methodology

-   We use the synthetic control method described in Abadie et al. (2008)

-   To construct a synthetic city for each treated city, we minimize the gap in PM2.5 trends before construction time.

-   We also include 47 meteorology variables, CO2, NO2, and SO2 emissions from power plants in the same county, and number of public bus and car trips.
