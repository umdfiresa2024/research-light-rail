## Treated Area

As particulate matter is one of the most damaging air pollutants, we use ground-level PM2.5 concentrations to represent city-level air quality. PM2.5 data comes from Di et al. (2019), which provides daily PM2.5 concentrations in grid cells at a resolution of 1 km for the years 2000 to 2016.

For each treated city, we identified which highway light rails could potentially serve as a substitute, and we extracted daily levels of PM2.5 in areas within 1 km of those highways.

## Untreated Area

Untreated areas have similar levels of alternative transportation before the light rail system was put into place. Additionally, the PM2.5 concentration was calculated by drawing a 30 km radius around each cityâ€™s centroid, and cropping interstates segments that fall within that centroid, then drawing 1 km radius around each cropped interstate. We then find the daily average PM2.5 levels within each 1 km radius around the cropped interstate area for each city.
